funds account suntrust bank in early xxxx i deposited a cheque from suntrust to my xxxx xxxx xxxx in xxxx this cheque was rejected by suntrust for some unknown reason no attempt was made to contact me by email or text to alert me that a suspicious cheque had been received i became uncomfortable with the fact that my funds might be at risk if left with suntrust xxxxxxxx i called suntrust and asked to close my account send the balance by xxxx at my expense to myself in xxxx at xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx the agent said ok and took my information i asked her to repeat the address or i could email the address to make sure it was correct she answered no need i have it two weeks later i called suntrust to see where this cheque was the agent said the account was closed on xxxx2021 and a cheque had been sent regular mail and it would take at least 10 days she asked that i wait a few more days called again at 3 weeks and the agent said part of the address was missing but would not say which part i asked how a cheque of this size could be mailed with an incomplete address reply not sure in a confusing tone i asked that the bank put an immediate cancellation on this cheque and issue a new one to the right address she replied we would need the original cheque back before they take any action i asked how i was to return a cheque that was lost in the mail and if i had it why would it need to be returned i could just deposit she then said she would put in the request called again at 4 weeks same response except this time the agent was not sure that the said cheque had ever been mailed again i asked that this cheque be cancelled and the funds returned to my account she replied that the account had been closed and that they could not reactivate from internal that the local branch on xxxx xxxx in xxxx xxxx would have to do it i tried calling the branch at xxxx numbers one i got a message that the branch was closed and the other said leave a message week 5 and none has got back to me from any of these contacts xxxxxxxx called asked for a supervisor who checked with the internal department and said i would need to complete the attached letter and request the funds again called xxxxxxxx agent patience spoke to internal again and they were to put a stop on the original cheque and issue a new cheque i was to call back on friday xxxx xxxx spoke with xxxx who stated that they needed a few more days before they could investigate and respond xxxxxxxx each call takes 15 to 30 minutes by the time i answer all security questions and wait 5 to 10 mins between agents these are international calls and very expensive spoke to the agent and asked to be transferred to patience the last supervisor to look at my case she would not take the call however said that i would now have to provide a signed letter of indemnity this letter would be mailed to me regular mail i replied just email the form and i can mail it back agent we cant do that ok then send it to me by courier agent sorry we cant do that me so your going to send this form by mail like you did with my cheque weeks ago like my cheque this letter may or may not be mailed causing another month delay it looks to me like you are using every possible tactic to delay sending my money or you are simply trying to steal it agent no we wouldnt do that i asked for the contact info for head office and their legal department reply we cant give those out i asked to speak to someone in upper management i was patched through to xxxx xxxx who claimed to be a manager i expressed my discontent with their tactics and stated that it was absurd in this age of technology to have to mail a blank form and further hijack a clients account in this manner we are rvers on a cross country trip and forced to stay put waiting for a letter that may or may not even have been mailed this cost us an extra 60000 in fees last month i stated again that i was lied to from the very beginning so i am very suspicious of what anyone from suntrust suggests at this time the manager xxxx said he could arrange for a call from head office now i have to stay by my phone waiting for a call that may never occur the very fact that they are requesting an indemnity letter is in itself an admission of guilt or wrong doing so far not one agent has mentioned a reference code for this issue not one has provided the same answer not one has mentioned notes on file about prior contact and each time the matter gets referred to some internal department my conclusions so far is that suntrust either is deliberately trying to delay my funds or simply keep my money the only other explanation is that the agents are deliberately messing with this transaction or this bank is just that incompetent my account was closed based on a phone call now a phone call is not acceptable to reverse this transaction or come to some means of returning the funds taken from me 5 weeks past your cooperation in resolving this issue as soon as

federal government fbi will do an investigation on the fraud department and all other departments in bank of america this bank continues to go in circles with their responses sending me a packet that still has not answered any of my questions in the original compliant see below i never asked for a refund nor would i ever want to do business with this bank again why did the bank allow a customer of theirs keep the xxxx funds after i filed a police report stating it was a fraudulent transaction also this bank continues to cover up for employees that are fraudulently allowing things like this happen my personal bank information was stolen from me i never gave anyone permission as the bank stated in their letter once again the bank does not want to accept fault and continues to blame the customer the problem is bank of america was lazy in doing their investigation i would call to check on my claim and none of the customer service representatives had their information together the bank never tried to even refund either of the accounts after xxxx xxxx was said to have an account as well with bank of america its not right for the government to allow banks to keep employees that commit fraud and then the bank covers everything up the police were involved but they can not do an investigation on all the banks in going and outgoing transactions through all the departments this would include getting information on all the employees especially the ones that have access to any transactions that include monies bank of america had the opportunity to retrieve my monies as i was told that it may have been an inside job whereas xxxx xxxx was an account holder as well of this bank supposedly xxxx xxxx is close friend of hers xxxx xxxx had the ability to call on my accounts check the balance and find ways to withdraw the money in the police report you will see listed to whom the money was transferred or withdrawn without my authorization xxxx xxxx was also said to have members of the bank that she was close friends with that could monitor other bank of america account holders if bank of america would check her account history i am sure they would see lump sums of monies being transferred to her account and maybe some withdrawals of that same amount xxxx xxxx withdrew xxxx and xxxx through xxxx transfer xxxx xxxx withdrew xxxx through xxxx transfer i did not authorize any of these transfers on my checking or savings account i would like say as well do to the nature of this incident and the poor communication with bank of america i had to replace my xxxx and xxxx cell phones as well as change my phone numbers i did not want to risk them being spammed or hacked per directions of the wireless provider i filed a police report in hopes that bank of america would do their diligence to retrieve all the monies back that were unauthorized the employees at bank of america were lazy did not do everything they could to get any of the money back this bank and other banks i will not list their names continue to have a bad history of employing people that will locate account holders of their bank to commit fraud xxxx xxxx xxxx is reporting erroneous information suspected fraud activity this was actual fraud unauthorized transactions on my checking and savings account with bank of america this also included two balances xxxx and xxxx this will be the banks loss due to their own negligence for not being consistent with the investigation at the time i reported it to the bank they had plenty of time to get all the money back xxxx xxxx is also reporting erroneous information transacting or attempting to transact with an account in an unauthorized or prohibited manner both of these companies have no supporting documentation to submit erroneous claims against me my credit worthiness and credit report is beyond great until this incident occurred last fall of 2018 ive been doing my own investigation as well other legal individuals in hopes to protect other account holders that currently bank with bank of america this is a very serious matter especially when a bank does not admit fault but only continues to put all the blame on the account holder just so they want have to take a loss and their criminal employees can remain working their to steal innocent people money i want the erroneous information from xxxx xxxx xxxx and xxxx xxxx to be removed bank of america to needs to admit fault for not bothering to do a so call investigation until after i reported them to the cfpb had it been done before all the monies lost could have been placed back in my accounts i will also be filing a suit against bank of america xxxx xxxx xxxx and xxxx xxxx for all the humiliation and stress this has me has caused as my record has been beyond

depot window s installation to v p s and address at xxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx ohio xxxx xxxx xxxxyear installation was completed with the wrong color trim and no knowledge of which windows had tint placed in them the windows with tint were supposed to be placed on the left side of the house calls were made to xxxx xxxx regarding these concerns eventually it was set up to have home depot come back out and fix the trim color emails sent back and forth from installation team noted that the color we originally picked was never actually available and we were to pick a different color we did not have the options in front of us so we said to pick something similar the color that was chosen we okayed however the color that was eventually reinstalled was not even remotely close to the original color that we picked again these are noted in the emails attached we tried to tell home depot that the color we agreed on in the email was not the same color that they actually put on our windows but nobody seemed to care or listen we finally convince them to come back and place a entirely different color on a coloxxxx that we werent very pleased with but we seem like we did not have many other options i began noticing with the windows that when they were closed the other window would move with it and it was difficult to lock and unlock xxxx xxxx told me this sometimes happens with new windows and for me to let them settle in i gave it some time but the windows never got better only worse so i called xxxx again and he said he would come out to check them he came out and agreed the windows were not right he also mentioned that there were several customers with these windows having the same problems he wasnt sure if it was an installation issue or a manufacturing issue and assured me that if i could be patient he would figure out the solution for us i also again mentioned about not knowing which windows actually had tint but he still had no answer for that either i started waiting weeks and then months checking in here and there with xxxx to see if there have been any updates but every time we spoke it was another still finding a solution answer after months start going by i begin to become worried because the cold months are upon us and with these windows that fall open they dont close fully and have cold drafts which are uncomfortable and losing money with energy loss at this point i start becoming a little more aggressive about calling xxxx and also calling the management team they start putting me through the customer service process which also takes more months and still nothing seems to get done the last time i spoke with xxxx he assured me that if i could just be patient they will resolve everything and i should get compensation for all of my concerns and tribulations finally the manufacturer of the windows sends somebody out to check the windows he discovers that two of the windows that were supposed to have the tint were indeed placed on the wrong side of the house he fixed those windows then when noticing the issue he wasnt sure but thought maybe he could place stronger balancers on the window to help he did that to all of the windows except one that was being blocked and asked me to test the windows when i tested the windows the issue seemed to get slightly better but still was not resolved he tried telling me that i closed the windows too hard and to just close them gently and the issue wouldnt happen i disagreed with him saying im not slamming them these windows are faulty im closing them in a normal way he continued to disagree with me and say that he was going to write that in his report i had no followup from anyone so i needed to call for myself upon calling several times and finally getting a hold of somebody they said that the manufacturer saw no faults to the windows at this point i had been trying to call xxxx xxxx and he would never pick up my calls i also mentioned that the installation team could also call him but nobody ever seemed like they wanted to i called and called and had to wait weeks at a time for someone to say they were going to call me back but never would i will attach all of the call logs so then i decided the only other option i had was to start a dispute the first dispute i started i attached documents but the dispute got declined the second dispute also got declined the third dispute got resolved and my card was credited initially but then all of the funds were put back on my card without any warning the reasoning for the funds getting put back on my card were because i did not attach documentation which this brings me to this letter overall this experience of home depot installation has been one of the most stressful experiences ive ever had highly unprofessional customer service and installation team im just looking for someone to make it right and no one seems to want to do that please consider this dispute and the time that it has taken and funds it has taken from me as well,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",OH,44266,,Consent

2019-02-27,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,i have multiple accounts with capital one including a business checking savings account for one of my businesses i attempted consolidating one of my external business accounts by opening a second business savings capital one unbeknownst to me without any notice capital one froze my business accounts simply due to requesting to open a savings account online which is the same way that our accounts were initially setup i found out about this only by calling into xxxx xxxx cust serv after my business debit card was declined during this time i literally had no access to even see my accounts online couldnt even see my account balances upon speaking with capital one i asked to speak with an exec level supervisor or manager to confirm whether or not our ach deposits and payments would still be processed in spite of the temp frozen account status the managersupervisor emphatically confirmed multiple times that all ach payments deposits wouldnt be effected by this status and that they would for sure still be processed per usual therefore i didnt have a reason to make other arrangements for our outgoing payments and inbound deposits however i was given false information by the aforementioned manager all of our deposits payments were rejected consequently our largest personal loan account was reported as being 30 days late we lost a premium domain potentially worth several thousands of dollars our business was and still is reported to xxxx which has caused several rejected ach payment fees and all of this due to this payment not going through in spite of being given a definitive guarantee that it would absolutely go through additionally due to the 30 day late payment status our loan account was now subject to several thousands of dollars in retroactive interest charges i immediately contacted capital one they accepted responsibility for the error and guaranteed to compensate us for any losses due to their error and that they would do so in a timely manner unfortunately to our continued detriment capital one didnt stand behind this guaranteepromise in spite of us sending countless documentation supporting our losses i sent countless emails to their executive office and to the general counsel but didnt receive a response for almost 2 months at one point at which time they offered us xxxx for a matter that has cost us far more up to this point and will ultimately end up costing in excess of 50 60k due to capital ones continued inaction our loan account is now standing at 120 days past due with a balance of just over 12k and our credit has now crept just below 600 our scores have always been well over 700 further two of our current creditors have significantly reduced our credit line 1 xxxx it xxxx 2600000 reduced to 1000000 2 xxxx xxxx of xxxx xxxx xxxx 700000 closed by creditor due to very recent and significant delinquency reported this is now creating problems for my business as we used the xxxx xxxx for an onfile card for our largest equipment wholesaler and now we are maxed out which caused our utilization to balloon from 2025 to 80 i have spoke to capital ones retained attorney through xxxx xxxx and have provided all supporting documentation including info directly from our credit report directly from xxxx yet i am still being subjected to methodical delays and evasive tactics by capital one all while being subjected to what has been a snowball effect due to how long capital one is taking to do what they promised they would do i have consulted with our attorney and in order to simply begin the litigation process we would be required to pay a xxxx retainer fee i feel as if we are now being disrespected more and more each day that capital one fails to make good on their promise of compensating for their admitted errors lastly my wife is xxxx xxxx xxxx and this is adding stress that she shouldnt be subjected to during this important stage of her xxxx yet capital one has essentially implied that they could care less which i can only assume is because they have no one to hold them accountable for mistakes that they openly and expressly admitted and did so in writing via a signed notarized statement that i requested in an attempt to mitigate further losses i have requested additional information from their attorney and they continue to act as if they just dont care to hear my requests i understand that there are likely hundreds of claims that are without any merit whatsoever and i have been consistently reminded of this by capital ones attorneys but i have provided ample even excessive certainly repititive documentation to substantiate my losses unequivocally speaking the ridiculous part about all of this is that it all stems from me requesting to do something as simple as opening a 2nd savings account and trying to bring an additional xxxx on deposit with their bank we have absolutely zero

allow nfcu to do the right thing in this situation on wednesday xxxxxxxx that my debit card for my account was no longer usable for a year this didnt phase me because i had already made it known that the account should be closed so on xxxxxxxx i called nfcu and spoke with a customer service department after asking about when my account would be closed i was told that day xxxx xxxx xxxx 1st lie i then brought up the letter about my debit card i asked to make sure everything else was okay with the other debit cards she checked at told me it was only for the card to the account i was closing we talked a few minutes about id theft because we both had been through this issue although she admitted my situation was far worse i asked again to make sure all my other cards were working and safe to be used from their end she assured me again checking other accounts that it was a block for only that card after that she told me they send those letters out when someone is closing an account after only having it opened a short time i told her i understood that but that with the fraudulent charges on that account it was what nfcu recommended that i do she told me that would be the way to deal with it as she was looking up my account she saw that i had been issued 15 debit cards to 4 accounts i told her yes it was because every single time i opened a new account it would have fraud issues i told her i had spoken with all three credit unions the ftc state and local law enforcement xxxx and usps and the social security administration i explained xxxx had done a deep web search and found out all my information was out there for people to buy or sell that was the reason my accounts were hacked they had my social security number i told her when i was well enough to go into public places i would be applying for a new ssn she told me that she would do the same she then asked if my illness was ongoing i told her that i have been battling xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx and xxxx xxxx for about 7 years that i was immune compromised so going into public places was always a high risk for me she told me she hoped that the doctors would find answers i said thats why im asking to make sure my other debit card would work she told me emphatically yes so if you lost count that was four times in that conversation alone that i was told that my debit card would be just fine later that same day xxxxxxxx around xxxx xxxx i tried to purchase some otc medication on xxxx and my card wouldnt work i called nfcu again and spoke with a man who worked in the fraud department what was going on with my debit card he told me after looking at my account that everything was fine that my debit card was not blocked in any way he said it was probably a glitch in the system i asked if he was absolutely sure after i told him about the letter he assured me that the letter was strictly for the account i was closing so i asked when the system glitch would be over he said to give it an hour or so i waited until around xxxx xxxx to try buying my medications on xxxx again and again my card was denied so then i went to another website and tried my card on that site again my card was denied at this point i was frustrated i called nfcu again at around xxxx xxxx and was transferred to the fraud department again i told them the glitch was still going on or there was something wrong with my card this time i was told that my debit card to my new personal account had been canceled and i would no longer be able to have a single account card until xxxxxxxx i asked why and was given the reason that i was in breach of my debit card agreement knowing this was not true i pulled out my agreement and read through each of the sections over the phone when we got to number 10 it said they could cancel my cards at any time for any reason without telling me first however two other rules stated that nfcu will alert a member if there is a problem with their account since i had called in twice previously this was absolutely not okay with me the man then told me to call back the next day and speak to a supervisor i asked him why couldnt i just talk to one now since i was away from home getting treatment at the xxxx xxxx in florida he said they were busy i could tell this conversation was going nowhere so i agreed to call back the next day so to quickly summarize xxxxxxxx i was told my new debit card was fine and would continue to work six times then i was told that all cards in my name had been canceled until xxxxxxxx i was told i couldnt speak to a supervisor given the reason they were canceled made no sense at all this was causing a lot of stress when i already told nfcu i had major xxxx issues these problems were keeping me from being able to do the things i needed to do like pay for medications at xxxx order new otc meds from xxxx buy the other things i needed while away from home my xxxx told me that i am not to be under stress being lied to six times and not being able to fix the problem was beyond stressful to the point it was hurting me physically xxxxxxxx i called back since that is what i was told to do i asked to speak to a fraud department supervisor and i was told that none were in the office until monday xxxxxxxx i told them i was told by a fraud department worker to call back on the xxxx the customer service rep ask me what the problem was i told her what had happened she said she couldnt do anything about my account or debit card because it was already with the fraud department i said fine does my debit card for my joint account with my husband work she said yes and the only way nfcu could cancel it would be if my husband asked for me to be taken off the account since he was the primary owner that the fraud department or nfcu didnt cancel debit cards to joint accounts unless the owner wanted it if they did so it would be in breach of contract so i thought that well at least i could try to do things using that card it was not a good solution however it would give me access to my money so that day was a bust for the most part all that happened was the man on xxxxxxxx just wanted me off the line telling me to call on a saturday when the fraud department wasnt open finding out that the joint account card which i rarely touch because of how my family does banking would still be in use so i have one working card better than nothing monday xxxxxxxx i called nfcu bright and early at xxxx xxxx i asked to speak with a fraud department supervisor i was told i would have to speak to a fraudsecurity team member first fine so i was put on hold for seven minutes until a fraud team member came on the line and asked me what my problem was i explained about the debit card being closed without a reason as to why it was closed i told them that i had been told 6 times that my card would not be closed and yet it was i told the person that the only card i could use was to the joint account and that didnt work well for me i was placed on a brief hold 16 minutes the rep came back on the line and said yes all cards had been canceled and the decision would not be reversed to just use the joint account so i asked if the joint account card would work i was again told unless my husband the main owner called and had the card canceled that they couldnt cancel that card because that would put nfcu in breach of contract i said okay i still wanted to speak to a supervisor about my account because i deserved an answer about why my other card had been canceled so i was put on a brief hold again 8 minutes the rep came back and said the person i would need to talk to wasnt in and that they had no idea when the person would be in but i could leave a voicemail and they would call me back so after being transferred which amounted to another 18minute hold i was sent to a survey they do at the end of every call i was very very very annoyed and called right back this time i spoke with another fraud department rep she transferred me to her boss almost instantly after the supervisor xxxx was looking over my accounts and the situation that was happening she said this that they canceled my card because i am only allowed to have six debit cards a year in my name i couldnt have more than five fraud claims a year and i was considered a highrisk member i thanked her for her honesty about why my card was canceled here though is where i ran into a problem none of the reasons she gave me were stated anywhere in the debit card contract and every card was issued by the advice of an nfcu rep that every fraud claim i had filed had been found to be actually fraudulent by nfcu and that the policy written in the debit card contract said i was to be issued a new card for any fraud on my account so the reasons contradicted their own policies she agreed that i was 100 right she told me i could appeal the decision to include all my efforts to stop the fraud as well as any medical reasons why the decision was the wrong one until then i could get a prepaid card i told her no that if i was getting prepaid it would not be through nfcu after all this she also told me the joint account card would stay open per contractual agreement so the xxxxxxxx calls were a little more productive at least in getting the reasons nfcu had canceled my card but not any solution to finding out how to fix my personal account debit card even though a fraud supervisor said that i had done nothing wrong i was also told again my joint account card would be just fine lets remember my joint account card would remain open because closing it would be in breach of contract which was said to me five different times by 3 different people xxxxxxxx i tried to use my joint account card and guess what it was denied i called nfcu and talked to a fraud supervisor named xxxx who told me that i would not be able to have cards with nfcu until xxxxxxxx i told him i had been told numerous times by different people that they couldnt take that card away from me unless my husband requested it needless to say he hadnt requested it brain suggested i go into a local nfcu to get cash i told him i was immune compromised and that wouldnt be a safe option for me he said that he was sorry my appeal had been denied but there was nothing he could do about it my claim was denied because i had 15 debit cards and had more than 7 fraudulent charges totaling over two thousand dollars that it was a mathematical algorithm that decided i was to high a risk i was so stressed frustrated and honestly angry none of this was good for my xxxx i in fact suffered a xxxx xxxx that very day so to sum it all up i had spoken to 7 associates of nfcu that my joint account debit card would be fine due to contractual agreements i had 4 fraud supervisors agree that none of the fraud and cards were my fault and that it was not written in any debit card agreement the number of cards a member could have i spent well over 8 hours on the phone with different people over the last ten days to get nowhere because there is nothing anyone can do so this letter is to reach out one last time to nfcu and then i will be moving on to the xxxx and consumer finical to get arbitration or court set up on this mess nfcu has a code of ethics on its website for the world to see 1 act with the highest grade of integrity which requires honesty and being candid i was lied to several times and given the rule around many times 2 accept and recognize personal responsibility to build and maintain the nfcu name the opposite is happening 6 use the highest level of professionalism and courtesy this didnt happen either after telling people how much i love nfcu i now am beyond mad to hurt by the way i have been treated i have had undue xxxx xxxx
